# Problem Statement: Make an app which changes theme (dark theme and light theme) based on a button

### 1. Create a new project with 'create-react-app' with appropriate commands.
### 2. Once the project is made, remove all the default code provided and start with a clean slate to make your own components.
### 3. Make the application with following features and functional components
 - I should be able to change the theme of the entire app based on a button (Switch between light theme and dark theme)
 - Use context API to make global level variables.
 - You can also choose any previous assignment project and implement this functionality on top of it.

### Note - Visualise the UI on your own and come with a nice interactive user experience.
